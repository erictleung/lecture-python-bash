* Graph Basics and NetworkX

* Working with Nodes and Objects

* Working with Edges and Connections

* Drawing Graphs in Different Ways

* Analyzing Graph Metrics

** Degree of Nodes

** Centrality as a Way for Node Importance

* Basic Graph Algorithms

** Graph Traversal/Search

** Community Detection

* Summary

- Graphs are collections of nodes/objects and edges/connections
- NetworkX gives package to manipulate graph objects
- There are multipleways to draw/plot the same graph
- Properties of the graph allow you to analyze and make inferences on network
- Algorithms on graphs explore more sophisticated properties of graphs
