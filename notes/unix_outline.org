* Unix and Linux Background

- Unix is operating system developed at Bell labs in 1970s

- Linux developed in 1991 by Finnish-American programmer and computer scientist
  Linus Torvalds
  - Linux and derivations are Unix-like, which act very much like original Unix
    operating system

- Multiple "flavors" of Linux with different purposes and uses
  - Ubuntu = general purpose
  - elementary OS = fast and open replacement for Windows and macOS
  - Arch Linux = simple, lightweight distribution

- Linux mascot is Tux the penguin

* Basic Linux Commands
** Navigation Commands

When you're confronted with a terminal, here are a few basic commands to get
you around your computer.

| Command | Description             | Plain Words                         |
|---------+-------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| pwd     | Print working directory | Your location in your computer      |
| ls      | List directory contents | Look at what's around your location |
| cd      | Change directory        | Move your position in your computer |

In sum, the above commands help you navigate around your computer.

*** pwd

You can use ~pwd~ to show you where you are in your computer.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pwd
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** ls

After knowing where you are, you should find out what files and directories are
around you.

You can use various options to change the output depending on what is
interesting to you.

| Option | Description                          |
|--------+--------------------------------------|
| -l     | Format into a list                   |
| -a     | List all files e.g. hidden dot files |
| -t     | Order by last time modified          |
| -r     | Reverse order results                |
| -X     | Group by file type/extension         |

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls
#+END_SRC

*** cd

It is no use if you can't go any where, so let's start moving around the
computer using ~cd~.

Here are some key character to know when using ~cd~.

- ~.~ (single period) = this is where you are currently
  - E.g. ~cd .~ = stays where you are
- ~..~ (double period) = go up the parent directory
  - E.g. ~cd ..~ = goes up

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pwd
  cd ../
  pwd
#+END_SRC

** File Manipulations

Once you're able to move aroudn you computer, let's move around files and
perform very simple changes to your files.

| Command | Description                  | Plain Words                        |
|---------+------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| touch   | Change file timestamps       | Create new file if none existed    |
| cp      | Copy files and directories   | Make clones of everything          |
| mv      | Move (and rename) files      | Change where files are in computer |
| rm      | Remove files or directorires | Delete files and be cautious using |
| mkdir   | Make directories             | Create new positions/folders       |
| rmdir   | Remove empty directories     | Remove empty folders on computer   |

In sum, the above commands help create, move, and delete files and directories.

*** touch

Moving around your computer is great and all, but without files to open and
edit, it can be kind of boring.

The ~touch~ command is used for creating empty files quickly.

This can be useful in creating a skeleton of an analysis workflow.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  touch new_file_1.txt
#+END_SRC


  mv new_file_1.txt new_dir/
  rm new_file_2.txt

*** cp

Now that we have some files, you can create more with ~cp~.

The ~cp~ command is used to *copy* files and directories.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cp new_file_1.txt new_file_2.txt
  ls
#+END_SRC

*** mv

The ~mv~ command is used to *move* files and directories around your computer.

Another use for this command is to *rename* things on your computer.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mv new_file_2.txt new_file_2_update.txt
  ls
#+END_SRC

*** rm

The ~rm~ command *removes*/*deletes* files and directories around your
computer.

This command is very powerful so use with caution. There are lots of jokes with
telling new coders to just delete their entire computer or database. Don't fall
for this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rm new_file_2_update.txt
  ls
#+END_SRC

*** mkdir and rmdir

Creating lots of files can get messy, so having an organization structure with
folders can help keep your files tidy.

The ~mkdir~ command *makes* directories, while the ~rmdir~ command *removes*
(empty) directories.

#+BEGIN_SRC
  mkdir new_dir
  cd new_dir
  pwd
#+END_SRC

** File Permissions

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  chmod
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Summary of write persmissions and numbers.
#+NAME: fig:chmod
| Number | Permission               | rwx | Binary |
|--------+--------------------------+-----+--------|
|      7 | read, write, and execute | rwx |    111 |
|      6 | read and write           | rw- |    110 |
|      5 | read and execute         | r-x |    101 |
|      4 | read only                | r-- |    100 |
|      3 | write and execute        | -wx |    011 |
|      2 | write only               | -w- |    010 |
|      1 | execute only             | --x |    001 |
|      0 | none                     | --- |    000 |

** Environment

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  which python
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: /usr/bin/python

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo $PATH
  PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  echo $PATH
#+END_SRC

Close your terminal. Are changes to your path still there?

** curl and wget

** scp and sftp
* Miscellaneously Useful Tools
** Screen and tmux

~Screen~ and ~tmux~ are called "terminal multiplexers".

This is a fancy way of describing how to use a single terminal window and
create new terminals from within it, without opening another window.

Here are some benefits to using a terminal multiplexer:

- Quickly switch between contexts
- Use when network connection unreliable
- Pick up progress quickly on a server when you login

** GNU Make 

In programming, we want to no repeat ourselves. So people made GNU ~make~ as an
automation (build) tool.

This was initially used to systematically build and compile complex programs
with lots of dependencies. You will see this a lot with C/C++ programs.

However, this tool can also be used in automating tasks for data analysis and
describe exactly what you've done.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
rule : dependencies
    commands ...
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
article.html : article.md
     pandoc -i article.md -o article.html
#+END_SRC

A slightly better and more robust rule.

#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
all : article.html

%.html : %.md
    pandoc -i $< -o $@
#+END_SRC

Using the above ~Makefile~, you can use the command ~make all~ in the command
line to run the rule.
